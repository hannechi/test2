                <h3>HTML5</h3>
                <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is
                    the fifth and
                    final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current
                    specification
                    is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology
                    Working Group
                    (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).</p>
                    <p>
                        HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C
                Recommendation" status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support
                for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by
                humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.,
                without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended
                to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]
